# ReRoll Witcher Class

> A conversion of the 5etools Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition Witcher Class for ReRoll

This conversion is a once-off conversion and I do not promise to keep it up-to-date with any alterations to the original schema which can be found [here](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew/blob/master/class/johnofbohemia%3B%20Witcher%20Class.json).

## Additional information that was not supported by the ReRoll Schema

### Class Info

> Indeed, there is nothing more repulsive than these monsters that defy nature and are known by the name of witcher, as they are the offspring of foul sorcery and witchcraft. They are unscrupulous scoundrels without conscience and virtue, veritable creatures from hell capable only of taking lives... — Anonymous, Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers

Professional monster slayers for hire, witchers are individuals who have undergone intense training and dangerous mutations to make them both capable and versatile fighters against a vast array of inhuman opponents.
